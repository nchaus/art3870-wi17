    <h1 id="title">  WOmen'S ART: A manIFESTO 1972</h1>

      <p>THE POSITION OF ART IN THE WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT IS THE POSITION OF WOMAN IN THE ART'S MOVEMENT.
      </p>

      <p>THE HISTORY OF WOMAN IS THE HISTORY OF MAN.
      </p>

      <p>because man has defined the image of woman for both man and woman,
        men create and control the social and communication media such as science and art,
        word and image, fashion and architecture, social transportation and division of labor.
      </p>

      <p> men have projected their image of woman onto these media,
        and in accordance with these medial patterns they gave shape to woman.
      </p>

      <p>if reality is a social construction and men its engineers, we are dealing with a male reality.
      </p>

      <p>  women have not yet come to themselves, because they have not had a chance to speak insofar as they had no access to the media.
      </p>

      <p>let women speak so that they can find themselves,
        this is what I ask for in order to achieve a self-defined image of ourselves and thus a different view of the social function of women.
        we women must participate in the construction of reality via the building stones of media-communication.
      </p>
